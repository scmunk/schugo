## A Modeling Language

Archimate is an architecture modeling language produced and supported by [TOGAF][1]. It is currently on its third major release. The language can be used to model everything from strategy to physical implementations. 

Although Archimate is presented as a Enterprise Architecture language it still seems to be oriented towards its technology roots. There are many other people disucssing what architecture needs in a language or approach and some agree that Archimate is acceptable and other say it is too techncial. I will leave that debate alone for now sicne Archimate is one of the few specifications that are both available and well supported for now.
