Secret Chipmunk, otherwise known as Ron Parker, is a non-reluctant CISSP, CCSP, diagrammer, AWS Solution Architect-Associate, and recovering developer who provides excellent security direction for a Fortune 500 insurance company. This site is a whiteboard, a honing stone and maybe even a garbage disposal for security and risk ideas from an architect's point of view.
