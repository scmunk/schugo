Before we can talk about what drives us to secure anything we have to define what the goals of security are. These goals are the most basic building blocks of what we are trying to accomplish when we say we are applying security. You are securing for a reason. These reasons break down into three basic goals.

> Goal: object of the effort, what you were aiming for

### Confidentiality

Protect secrets from others seeing them
Protect privacy for an individuals information

Confidentiality has a second cousin called Privacy. Some people consider Privacy another branch of thinking aside from security. I am following the line of thinking that Privacy is actually under the larger umbrella of security as a whole.

### Integrity


### Availability


# Up Next
Now that we know what security buckets we have to use we can talk about what would motivate us towards one of these goals.

If you would like to discuss these goals in more detail, or if have other questions or comments please drop me a note at scmunk@secretchipmunk.com or [@scmunk](https://twitter.com/scmunk).
