      <description>A Quick Talk This is a quick tour through why we need to architect, a couple of the frameworks, and finally several helpful tools.
It started out as a 5-minute lightning talk but turn more into an 8-minute flashflood. I want to thank the @chadevs for giving me the time to come and speak to the great group there. There was a good crowd that filled up the room. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t attended a Chattanooga Developers, ChaDevs, Lunch Meeting then check them out on Meetup.</description>
